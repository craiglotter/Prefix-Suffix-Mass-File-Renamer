Prefix Suffix Mass File Renamer

Prefix Suffix Mass File Renamer is a very basic program that simply renames all files in a specified folder in such a way that the existing filenames are supplemented by adding the specified prefix and suffix. For instance, a folder containing three files, namely a.jpg, b.jpg and c.jpg combined with a prefix of 1 would become 1a.jpg, 1b.jpg and 1c.jpg respectively. The prefix and suffix can be specified. Note that the folder search is not recursive in nature but instead just a simple single level approach.
